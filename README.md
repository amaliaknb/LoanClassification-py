# LoanClassification

In this project I used Python to train Machine Learning Algorithms for classification purpose.
I used six algorithms in total, they are:

1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN
3. SVM
4. Naive Bayes
5. Random Forest 
6. SGD 

For the Model Evaluation, I used:
1. Mean Absolute Error
2. F1 Score
3. AUC
4. Accuracy
5. Confusion Matrix

This project was inspired from this two refrence, so go check them out:
